                         	<p>&quot;It is an interesting experience to be a young person living in Oakland with all the violence and oppression against youth, but it feels amazing to have a voice to know that you can make a change in your community.</p>
                          <p>At BAY-Peace we have the opportunity to make that change and to have our voices heard. An important aspect in any healthy community is to be able to hear how everyone is feeling about what goes on around them.&quot;</p>

                          <p>&quot;Having the opportunity to be a leader is amazing. Knowing that my community's voice is being heard and that we are the solution to violence, discrimination, and stereotypes is fascinating. BAY-Peace gives us these privileges and helps us with our leadership skills.&quot;

                         <p>&quot;Give us the opportunities to lead and we will rise to the challenge. Organizations like BAY-Peace empower and nurture youth leadership, promote civic involvement, and foster constructive activism.</p>
                         <p>The office is a second home, and the team members are our second family. BAY-Peace offers programming at different schools, and at different community spaces. However, what separates us from similar programming is their internship program.</p>
                         <p>I started out as an intern, and I can confidently say that it is the most powerful part of their program. Interns have decision making power over what they learn, how they learn it, and how they choose to apply what they are learning. Without the BAY-Peace internship, the confidence I have in life, and in my ability to influence a classroom wouldn't be nearly as high as it is now.&quot;</p>
